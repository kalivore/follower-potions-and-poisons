Version 2.00.02

Full release with Poisoning support
Added 'force add' option to MCM, to grab followers for whom the dialogue option doesn't appear


Version 2.00.01b

Changed SkyProc patcher to (hopefully!) avoid errors when importing mods
(it was the 'QUST' record type that I was importing which was causing errors - I only used it to check if CACO was present, so I'm now checking for a different record type and it's running OK for me, even with mods which previously caused errors)

Also found that it was double-adding perks(!), so stopped it doing that!


Version 2.00.00b

Beta release with support for follower Poisons! :D  See main page for full details of how to enable/customise poisoning behaviour.

Also made several changs under the hood, mainly around item tracking, and who each follower is fighting.  My main objective was to keep everything running briskly, and above all, not to slow the mod down for anyone who chooses not to use the new poison options.

The SkyProc patcher has also been updated to add keywords to Magic Effects on poisons, so followers can tell what they do.  This includes the 'MagicAlchDamageHealth', 'MagicAlchDamageStamina' and 'MagicAlchDamageMagicka' keywords, which are present in vanilla but not attached to any effects - I don't know why..


Version 1.03.00

Adding SkyProc Patcher. 
This became necessary, as NPCs need to have the "AlchemySkillBoosts" perk if they want to benefit from Fortify potions (eg Fortify Two-handed, or Fortify Destruction). 

Trying to do this in a fixed ESP would be madness, as there are so many other mods which edit NPCs there would be conflicts everywhere. Using SkyProc allows a customised patch to be created based on individual load order.



Version 1.02.00

Just bringing the Inventory Functions plugin & script in line with the new 3.01 version 
Also added the option to disable "no potions" reminders entirely



Version 1.01.00

Added option for followers to always use Fortify/Resist potions against certain enemy types (eg Dragons)



Version 1.00.00

First full release 

Very little actual change - just brought the functions from "Quad2Core's Inventory Functions" in line and up-to-date with the v2 of that plugin. 

Oh - and stopped the "Follower Potions - Maintenance Complete" message from showing on every game load ;)



Version 0.03.00

Added an option to control how the effects on a potion are recognised when a follower receives it. 

For example, recognise only Restore effects, meaning Fortify/Resist effects will be ignored totally. 

Additionally, player-made potions can be treated purely for their strongest, second-strongest, or third-strongest effect, meaning the classic Restore Health/Fortify health combo potion can be treated as just a Restore Health (or just a Fortify Health) potion. 

See description for full details, as this can get kind of complicated.. The default option, though, is for everything to work exactly as previously, so if you don't change anything, nothing will change ;)



Version 0.02.01

Grouped the 'no potion' messages for Fortify and Resist potions - so instead of saying "XXXX has no Resist Fire potions to use", it will just say "XXXX needs more Resist potions". Messages about Restore Health/Stamina/Magicka potions are still individual. 

Added configurable 'cooldown times' for potion reminders, so oyu can set a lower limit on how often you see the reminder messages. 

Added mod version number to MCM



Version 0.02.00

Added further checks for followers before using Fortify and Resist potions - they should now only use these if it is relevant. 

Fortify Marksman, Block, One-handed and Two-handed - check relevant weapon type (bow/crossbow, shield, 1H weapon or 2H weapon respectively) 

Fortify Light Armour/Heavy Armour - check for one or more items with the relevant Keyword (ArmorLight/ArmorHeavy respectively) 

Fortify (magic school) - check for at least one spell with the relevant School assigned (eg Flames has the Destruction school assigned) 

Resist Fire/Frost/Shock - check the enemy for one or more spells and/or Shouts with the relevant Keyword (MagicDamageFire/MagicDamageFrost/MagicDamageShock, respectively). A match on any of these will also trigger to use generic Resist Magic potions.
